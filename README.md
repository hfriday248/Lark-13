Name of game: Dungeons and Directories

Developed by: Gregory Jans, put name here, Hannah Friday

Narrative: You, an unknowing user, are actively being trapped inside of a pretty boring game. Thankfully, an unknown ally is here to guide you as you try to cheat your way through, hack, and ultimately escape the game, all the while trying to avoid suspicion from the game's host: Mr Game. Learn basic UNIX commands from the notes left by your anonymous companion in order to snoop through files and directories, filter text, and even make your own files

Instructions: to start the game, type ". main.sh"

    * any text put between square braces is meant to be placeholder text
        for example: if instructed to type: cat [filename], the text "[filename]" should be replaced with the name of an existing file

    * files may be changing as the game progresses, don't be affraid to re-read files or revisit game directories as you play

    * while there is a certain order to finish the levels in, the numbers may not be in order

    * if you are unsure what to do next, try to look for files named "note" as they will include hints pertaining to the puzzles

    * when entering a new directory, it is recommended to list the files that exist first before starting to solve the puzzle
        (no need to wory, entering directories and listing files will be taught during the game)

    * for first time UNIX users, it's recommended to keep a reminder of the commands you have learned so that they can be referenced later
